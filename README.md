# perlScript

This repository contains everything that I have done in DSO. This includes the configuration I have done on the Ubuntu 14.04.

## md.pl series(Match Define) ##
These series of Perl scripts are variations to find the authors who added defines and was removed by someone else. 

## mi.pl series (Match if statements) ##
These series of Perl scripts are made to find authors who added if statements which were changed by someone else.
mi4.pl: Match blocks of negatives and positives if statements. 
mi5.pl: Above + trying to get the full if statement by refering to the original file. 

## categorizeConstrains.pl ##
This script aims to categorize the constraints generated by mi.pl. 

## Documentation ## 
These are the documents I have written to keep track of the progress in DSO.

## Vim Configuration ##
These includes my configuration for VIM as well as creating a bash script to install vim with all the documentations.Using sudo ./vimConfig to install everything needed for vim.
